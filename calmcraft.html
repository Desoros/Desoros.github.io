      <h1>CalmCraft</h1>
      <p>CalmCraft is a minecraft server and community. We are known for our calm and kind ways. This is a server that I created on December 18th, 2019 and haven't looked back since. </p>
      <p>While the programming required for this project was minimal at best, I still learned a lot about decision making when it comes to project management and development.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I was able to acquire skills in people management and most importantly how to work successfully with a team!</p>
